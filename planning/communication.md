## Asking for Help

If you encounter a challenge, remember that in some cases prioritizing the success of the whole project is worth to. Consider this rule of thumb when you are stuck.

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
```
